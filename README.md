# 1090
# Project Name

This project aims to build a recommendation model (e.g., an article recommendation system) based on user click behavior data. By calculating item-to-item similarities, generating candidate recalls, and using a ranking model (such as LGBMRanker) to sort the recall results, we can improve the accuracy and MRR metrics of the recommendations.
